# Compiler-Design
Complete miniC to Assembly x86 compiler

The approach first converts the MiniC code to Three Address Code, which resembles assembly instructions. 
The next part converts this TAC to x86 assmebly instructions.   

The approach uses lexing and parsing using the Flex and Bison tools respecitively.
